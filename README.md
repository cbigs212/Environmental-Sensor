# Environmental-Sensor

Completed in May 2023, this is code for an Enviornmental Sensing station that can track data such as air and water temperature in C, K, and F. It can record humidity (%), battery voltage (V), and illuminance (lux) as well. It was programmed on Arduino software (using arduino's available libraries) with elements of C and C++. The code was downloaded and altered to fit sensors that we sautered ourselves.

Linked is a video presenting what the sensor looks like in action:
